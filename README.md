## Project 1: Equal Weight Strategy
This project implements an equal-weight portfolio strategy for the S&P 500. The strategy assigns an equal investment weight to all stocks in the index, rebalancing the portfolio periodically. It is designed to outperform the market-cap weighted strategy over long-term investment horizons.

- **File**: `Equal_Weight_S&P.ipynb`
- **Key Features**:
  - Data collection of S&P 500 stocks.
  - Portfolio rebalancing and performance tracking.
  - Analysis of historical returns compared to market indices.

## Project 2: Momentum Trading Strategy
The momentum strategy is based on the principle that assets with strong recent performance tend to continue performing well in the near future. This project develops a momentum-based trading algorithm for S&P 500 stocks.

- **File**: `Momentum_Strategy_S&P.ipynb`
- **Key Features**:
  - Identification of stocks with positive momentum.
  - Trade execution based on momentum signals.
  - Performance evaluation against the S&P 500 benchmark.

## Project 3: Value Strategy
This project focuses on implementing a value investing strategy that identifies undervalued stocks within the S&P 500. The strategy uses fundamental analysis to determine stocks trading below their intrinsic value.

- **File**: `Value_Strategy_S&P.ipynb`
- **Key Features**:
  - Stock screening based on valuation metrics (e.g., P/E ratios).
  - Portfolio construction using value-weighted methods.
  - Backtesting to assess historical performance.
