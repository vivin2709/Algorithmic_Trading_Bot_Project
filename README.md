# Algorithmic Trading Bot Development Guide

## Overview

This guide is designed for Vaibhav and Vivin, both students interested in funding, investments, and quantitative finance. It will walk you through the development of an algorithmic trading bot using Python. The bot will analyze market data, make trading decisions, and execute trades automatically.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of financial markets and trading concepts
- Familiarity with data analysis libraries like pandas and NumPy

## Tools and Libraries

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- NumPy
- TA-Lib (Technical Analysis Library)
- ccxt (Cryptocurrency Exchange Trading Library)
- matplotlib (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive development)

## Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

1. **Install Python and pip**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). Pip, the Python package installer, should be installed along with Python.

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv trading_bot_env
   source trading_bot_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `trading_bot_env\Scripts\activate`
